# Simple Java Game
A project developed for the Object-Oriented Programming course at AGH UST in the 2022/2023 academic year. This project was completed during 8 laboratory classes following instructions from [this](https://github.com/apohllo/obiektowe-lab) repository.

This is a simple JavaFX application that allows you to specify the movements of two animals on a grid. Its purpose is to teach basic object-oriented programming concepts.

## Launching the Application
To launch the application, you need the following:
- Jdk 16
- Gradle 7.4
- Dependencies from build.gradle

It is recommended to use InteliJ for running the game. Alternatively, you can use the `./gradlew.bat run` command in the main folder.

## Using the Application
Once the game has been launched, you can specify the movements of the animals on the screen by writing the desired moves (separated by spaces) in the text field and clicking the "Start" button.

Possible moves include:
- `f`: forward
- `r`: right
- `l`: left
- `b`: backward
